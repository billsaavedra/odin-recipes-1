First HTML Odin Project
Hello, my name is Matthew McCane. This will be my first project on www.TheOdinProject.com 

I will be practicing certain HTML skills that I have learned so far. Basically HTML Foundations such as using elements and tags, boilerplate, working with text, creating lists, along with links and images! I am very excited to start this project, and I really enjoy using this website!
